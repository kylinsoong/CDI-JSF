What is it?
-----------

This Demo demonstrates how to use CDI 1.0 Events.


The JSF front-end client allows you to create credit, debit, cash operation events


How to run test Demo?

. build and deploy to JBoss EAP 6 & JBoss AS 7
. test through http://localhost:8080/cdi-event
. enter an amount, choose a operation, and then click on *Pay* to create the event


A Session scoped (@SessionScoped) payment event handler catches the operation and produces (@Produces) a named list of all operations performed during this session. The event is logged in the JBoss console and the event list is displayed in a table at the bottom of the form.
